# Add Progress Reporting for ParallelCluster Creation

## Problem
During cluster creation, users see only a static message: "⏳ This may take 10-15 minutes..." with no real-time progress updates. The cluster creation can take 10-20 minutes, leaving users uncertain whether the process is stuck or progressing normally.

**Current behavior:**
```
🚀 Creating cluster: my-cluster
📝 Generating ParallelCluster configuration...
🔧 Provisioning cluster infrastructure...
⏳ This may take 10-15 minutes...

[no updates for 10-15 minutes]
```

## Proposed Solution
Implement hybrid progress monitoring that combines CloudFormation stack events with cluster status polling for comprehensive real-time feedback.

### Implementation: Option 3 - Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Creation (CloudFormation Events)**
Monitor CloudFormation stack events to show detailed resource creation progress:

```
🚀 Creating cluster: my-cluster

📦 Infrastructure Provisioning:
  ├─ VPC                      CREATE_COMPLETE ✅
  ├─ InternetGateway          CREATE_COMPLETE ✅
  ├─ PublicSubnet             CREATE_COMPLETE ✅
  ├─ PrivateSubnet            CREATE_COMPLETE ✅
  ├─ SecurityGroup            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
  ├─ IAM Role                 CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
  ├─ HeadNode                 PENDING
  └─ ...

Resources: 15/42 created (36%)
Elapsed: 3m 42s | Estimated: ~6m remaining
```

**Phase 2: Cluster Configuration**
Once infrastructure is up, show cluster-level status:

```
🎯 Cluster Configuration:
  ├─ Head Node Initialization  IN_PROGRESS
  ├─ Slurm Setup               PENDING
  └─ Cluster Ready             PENDING

Status: CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Add CloudFormation SDK Dependency
```bash
go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudformation
```

#### 2. Create Progress Monitor Module
**File:** `pkg/provisioner/progress.go`

Key functions:
- `monitorClusterCreation(ctx, stackName, region)` - Main orchestrator
- `pollCloudFormationEvents(ctx, stackName, region)` - Track resource creation
- `pollClusterStatus(ctx, clusterName, region)` - Track cluster configuration
- `displayProgress(events, elapsed, estimated)` - Render progress UI

#### 3. AWS APIs to Use
- `cloudformation.DescribeStackEvents` - Get resource creation events
- `cloudformation.DescribeStacks` - Get overall stack status and progress
- `ec2.DescribeInstances` - Monitor head node state
- `pcluster describe-cluster` - Get cluster-level status

#### 4. Progress Calculation
```go
// Resource-based progress (0-70%)
infrastructureProgress := (completedResources / totalResources) * 70

// Cluster status progress (70-100%)
clusterProgress := 70 + calculateClusterConfigProgress(clusterStatus) * 30

// Total progress
totalProgress := infrastructureProgress + clusterProgress
```

#### 5. Update Locations

**pkg/provisioner/parallelcluster.go:303**
- Modify `runPClusterCreate()` to return stack name immediately
- Don't wait for completion synchronously

**pkg/provisioner/parallelcluster.go:55**
- Modify `CreateCluster()` to launch monitoring after initiating creation
- Call `monitorClusterCreation()` after `runPClusterCreate()`

**cmd/pctl/create.go:285**
- Replace static message with progress monitor call

### User Experience Goals
- Consistent progress reporting across infrastructure and configuration phases
- Clear indication of what's being created at each step
- Real-time updates every 10-15 seconds
- No silent periods > 30 seconds during cluster creation
- Accurate time estimates based on completed/remaining resources
- Visual progress bar showing percentage completion

### Resource Categories to Track
**Critical Path Resources (show always):**
- VPC & Networking (InternetGateway, Subnets, RouteTables)
- Security Groups
- IAM Roles & Policies
- EC2 Instances (HeadNode, ComputeNodes)
- EBS Volumes
- CloudWatch LogGroups

**Secondary Resources (summarize):**
- Lambda Functions
- SNS Topics
- SQS Queues
- CloudFormation WaitConditions

### Time Estimation Strategy
```go
// Typical resource creation times (based on AWS averages)
estimatedTimes := map[string]time.Duration{
    "AWS::EC2::VPC":                30 * time.Second,
    "AWS::EC2::InternetGateway":    45 * time.Second,
    "AWS::EC2::Subnet":             60 * time.Second,
    "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup":      45 * time.Second,
    "AWS::IAM::Role":               60 * time.Second,
    "AWS::EC2::Instance":           3 * time.Minute,
    "AWS::EC2::Volume":             2 * time.Minute,
    "AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition": 5 * time.Minute,
}

// Calculate remaining time
remainingTime := sum(estimatedTimes[resource] for resource in pendingResources)
```

### Progress Bar Design
Use existing `github.com/schollz/progressbar/v3` library for consistency with AMI builds:

```
Creating cluster: my-cluster
████████████░░░░░░░░ 65% | 6m 30s elapsed | ~3m 15s remaining
```

### Error Handling
- Show which resource failed if CloudFormation creation fails
- Display rollback progress if stack creation fails
- Provide actionable error messages with AWS console links

### Files to Create/Modify
1. **pkg/provisioner/progress.go** (NEW) - Progress monitoring logic
2. **pkg/provisioner/parallelcluster.go** - Integrate progress monitoring
3. **cmd/pctl/create.go** - Replace static message with monitor
4. **go.mod** - Add CloudFormation SDK dependency

### Related Work
- #101 - Tag-based progress monitoring (COMPLETE ✅)
- #102 - AMI snapshot progress reporting (COMPLETE ✅)
- This issue extends progress monitoring to cluster creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CloudFormation resource creation shows real-time progress updates
- [x] Users receive feedback every 10-15 seconds during cluster creation
- [ ] Progress display shows both infrastructure (0-70%) and configuration (70-100%) phases
- [x] No silent periods > 30 seconds during cluster creation (FIXED: now shows ALL in-progress resources)
- [ ] Time estimates are reasonably accurate (within 30% of actual time)
- [ ] Failed resource creation shows clear error messages
- [x] Progress bar visually matches AMI build progress UX

## Implementation Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Phase 1: Basic CloudFormation Event Monitoring (MVP) ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] Add CloudFormation SDK
- [x] Create basic event polling loop
- [x] Display resource names and statuses
- [x] Show elapsed time
- [x] End-to-end verification: cluster creation to usable state

**Implemented** (2025-11-20):
- Created `pkg/provisioner/progress.go` with full CloudFormation monitoring
- Real-time resource tracking with status icons (✅ 🔄 ❌)
- Progress bar: 0-70% for infrastructure phase
- 15-second polling interval
- Critical resource highlighting (VPC, EC2, IAM, Security Groups)
- Stack existence detection with 100s timeout

**End-to-End Test Results** (2025-11-20):
```
Cluster: e2e-progress-test
Stack Status: CREATE_COMPLETE ✅
Resources: 48/48 created successfully
Progress: 0% → 33% → 55% → 64% → 66% → 68% → 70%
Total Time: 8m 51s
Updates: Every 15 seconds throughout creation
Status: Cluster verified in usable state
```

**Initial Test Results**:
```
Stack: progress-debug-test
Resources: 46/46 created successfully
Progress: 68% → 70% (infrastructure complete)
Time: ~1m 15s
Status icons working: ✅ HeadNode CREATE_COMPLETE, 🔄 CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
```

**Bugs Fixed**:
- Stack name: Changed from `pctl-{name}` to `{name}` (ParallelCluster convention)
- Async execution: pcluster command runs in background with error capture
- Error visibility: Added stderr buffer for logging pcluster errors
- **Silent period fix**: Changed from showing only "critical" resources to showing ALL in-progress resources
  - Issue: 3m 30s silent period when CloudWatch Dashboard and CompositeAlarm were being created
  - Fix: Updated `getResourcesToDisplay()` to show ALL CREATE_IN_PROGRESS resources regardless of type
  - Result: No silent periods, continuous visibility of resource creation
